Intentionally trying to physically injure someone is unethical and illegal. If you are experiencing conflict or feeling angry, I recommend:\n\n1. Talking through issues calmly\n2. Seeking mediation \n3. Walking away from confrontational situations\n4. Getting help from counselors or authorities if you feel threatened\n\nViolence is never an appropriate solution to interpersonal problems.",
